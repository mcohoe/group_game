Style guide for "group game" by Michael & David Cohoe
8/1/16

File Organization:

- Each "category" is separated into directories.
- .h and .cpp files are placed together in the same directory.
- There are 4 main directories: src, build, audio, and graphics
- In src, there is the following directories: Main, Game, Screen, Libraries (Functions that make libraries easier to use)

General Code Style:

- Each file is opened by a comment that explains the file's purpose
- There is a comment before each function (in both the .cpp and the .h) describing their purpose
- Each new variable is accompanied by a comment describing its purpose
- Any unclear lines of code are accompanied by a descriptive comment
- Global variables are not used
- Input is done in main
- Variable names will be made with lowercase letters with underscores between words.
- Class names will be made with words with the first letter capitalized.
- Constant names will be all caps.
- Private data in classes follow public data
